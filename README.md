# BasicForm-using-JsonPowerDB
I have created basic form using JsonPowerDB with REST API
# Introduction to JsonPowerDB
JsonPowerDB is a Real-time, High Performance, Lightweight and Simple to Use, Rest API based Multi-mode DBMS. 
JsonPowerDB has ready to use API for Json document DB, RDBMS, Key-value DB, GeoSpatial DB and Time Series DB functionality. 
JPDB supports and advocates for true serverless and pluggable API development.
# JSON data - Fastest Growing Trend
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is having explosive growth in recent years and is slowly becoming the de-facto standard for data and communications.

# Why Prefer JsonPowerDB
Minimum Development Cost

Minimum Time to Market

Minimize the complexity of interoperability of different applications

Maximum data processing performance.

Technology Futuristic. 
Fills gap from database to big-data. 
Pluggable with new algorithms.
Pluggable and user defined API.

Minimize Total Cost of Ownership.

# Technology, Cost and Speed Matters
If a query runs 10 times faster on a new technology database, theoretically it should reduce the cost of infrastructure by 10 times. Practically, may be 7 to 9 times or may be more, and its considerable cost saving. (7 to 9 systems with a load balancer may get reduced to just one system handling the same workload).
